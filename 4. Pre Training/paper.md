## TL;DR
<!--
50–100 words.
State the problem, the core idea, and why it matters.
This should be readable even if you never open the PDF again.
-->

---

## Overview
<!--
What problem does this paper address?
Why is it important now?
What is the high-level approach (minimal jargon)?
Explicitly note key assumptions.
-->

---

## System / Model Abstraction
<!--
Describe the core abstraction or execution model.
What are the main components or entities?
What guarantees or invariants does the system rely on?
-->

---

## System / Model Flow
<!--
If possible, describe the system as a sequence of steps.
Indicate where data flows, control decisions happen,
and where learning or inference occurs.

## AI vs Systems Boundary
<!--
Which parts are learned vs engineered?
Which components affect correctness vs performance?
Is learning essential, or could heuristics work?

## Analogies / Intuition
<!--
Provide a simple analogy or mental model.
Goal: conceptual clarity, not technical precision.
Example: “Expectation: GPU bandwidth is a waterfall. Reality: it’s a straw.”
