# GEN AI Systems Paper Reading List

This repository contains curated reading lists and notes for research papers in
**AI systems, distributed systems, and large-scale ML infrastructure**.

The goal of this repo is to organize papers thematically, preserve useful links,
and support structured reading and critique over time.

Each folder corresponds to a high-level topic, and contains a single `paper_name.md`
file with links to papers, videos, slides, and other relevant material.

Each folder contains:

## `paper_name.md` Format

Each `paper_name.md` file acts as a lightweight index for that topic and typically includes:
- Paper title and venue
- Links to PDFs (arXiv / publisher)
- Links to talks, videos, or slides (if available)
- Optional short notes or annotations
